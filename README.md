# RaiGallery - An NFT Market

Exercise for creating an NFT market.

This project is powered by:

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contracts
- [React](https://react.dev/), [Ant Design Web3](https://web3.ant.design/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for web app

For local development, Node.js 18+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) are recommended.

There is a related note about how I wrote the smart contract part: [智能合约纯小白是如何完成自己的第一个 dApp——NFT market？](https://github.com/openbuildxyz/Web3-Frontend-Bootcamp/discussions/821)
